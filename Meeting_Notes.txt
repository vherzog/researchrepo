Meeting 1:
- Redexer (byte rewrite tool)
- Start experiments testing application runs (comparisons)
- Start separate weekly meetings with Onur
- Onur presentation next Thursday (09/29)

Meeting 2:
- play drone application archive (use later instead of google play)
- REWRITING:
  - reread Redexer documentation -> determine main input
    - what language is used/injected for rewriting**
  - alternative to Redexer (if fails to work): Smali 
    - write Smali assembly code for manipulating dalvik bytecode
  - play with either method - print "hello world" in onCreate (know it will be called) to log & check if successful
- Application testing:
  - format observations in clear presentation & share!

Meeting w. Onur:
- worked on issues with Redexer installation


Meeting 3:
- to repackage app - create self signed key
    keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore -alias alias_name -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000

    #1 disassemble
    java -jar ~/bin/apktool.jar d <your-app-here>

    #2 modify your app

    #3 reassemble the package
    java -jar ~/bin/apktool.jar b <your-app-here>

    #4 sign the package
    jarsigner -verbose  -sigalg MD5withRSA -digestalg SHA1 -keystore ~/android/mykeystore com.amazon.mp3-2/dist
    /com.amazon.mp3-1.apk mykey

    #5 upload/install the app
    adb install <your-app-here>
- Sudoku -> find out how it generates random #s (java lang random / prng ?)
- EXERCISE:
  - experiment with snapchat: change app code so that photo timer never runs out (can view picture as long as you want)
- Method calls: change smali code to print every method called during app run to log
  - log.i
  - (write a program to automate this)
  - to start (learn smali syntax) -> change in onCreate, then check smali to see how string output is formatted
- Testing apps: start testing NON-gaming applications
  - test apps that are expected to replay properly, try to find non-determinism

Meeting 4:
- Smali - message to log - set at beginning of method
- try to get redexer working
- continue to look into snapcht timer modication as exercise
- continue to investigate random number generation (games like 2048)
  - APIs involed?
  - modify to pick a fixed seed

Meeting 5:
- (future note) - redexer: write auto identify - hooks certain line, finds and logs (replace network access with file)
- redexer - get it to work to log method calls in apk
- continue with RERAN experiments
- smali logging syntax (place beginning of method?)

Meeting with Onur (10/24):
- open email chain for issues
- continue looking into redexer - high level how it works (classes.dex  - what is that used for?)
- hardcoding smali code

Meeting 6: (11/2)
- 2048 exercise - only look into androbaby packages!! (uses Math.random())
- try to get redexer working - critical to next steps!

Meeting 7: (11/9)
- 2048 (quick task):
  - look into also seeding random locations of new numbers
  - run modified 2048 app with reran to prove new replay capabilities
- redexer:
  - check to see if redexer logging needs to be modified (if all methods are not being logged)
  - test redexer logging on deterministic applications (calculator)
  - when redexer logging works:
    - compare total appl log implementations vs. method logs called during application run
    - present in slide - bar graph !!
- for the FUTURE:
  - with redexer, instrument non-deterministics fixes 
  - ex: 2048 - use redexer to find random calls, remove, and replace with fixed seed code
  - good to show for UROP presentations!!

Meeting with Onur: (11/10)
- edit Logger.java to log method/api calls to txt file on phone
- create script to count # of times each method is called in a certain run
- smali code: redexer changes --- 
    invoke-static {v0}, Lorg/umd/logging/Logger;->logMethodEntry([Ljava/lang/Object;)V

Meeting 8: (11/30)
- check fb originally 
- the issues in the login applications may be due to self-checking capabilities in those apps
- do not write analysis programs in c++ (python better)
- analysis should have at least 10 applications
- look broader into other apps for non-determinisms (other than 2048)
